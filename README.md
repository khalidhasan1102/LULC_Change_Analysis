# LULC Change Analysis (GIS & Remote Sensing)

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) changes over time using GIS and Remote Sensing techniques. It helps understand urbanization, deforestation, and environmental change patterns.

## Objectives
- Prepare LULC maps for different time periods  
- Detect and quantify land cover changes  
- Analyze spatial and temporal patterns  

## Data Sources
- Landsat Satellite Imagery  
- Administrative boundary shapefiles  

## Tools & Software
- ArcMap / ArcGIS Pro  
- QGIS  
- Microsoft Excel  

## Methodology
1. Satellite image preprocessing  
2. Image classification  
3. LULC map preparation  
4. Change detection analysis  
5. Map layout and interpretation  

## Output
- LULC maps  
- Change detection maps  
- Statistical summaries  

## Applications
- Urban planning  
- Environmental monitoring  
- Climate change studies
